##example of when and why you would use a rescue block.  Getting info from a site API like facebook and for some reason their site might go down for 1 minute, but your site would give an error, but it would not be because of OUR site, but because of FACEBOOK's site.

#def get_facebook_messages
#  begin
#    contacts_fb
#    @messages = retrieves_messages
#  rescue => e
#    flash[:error] = "Error occured; contacting Facebook: #{e}"
#  end
#end

#there are still better ways to handle errors. For instance, there is no way to detect a syntax error using above set-up
